# Pizza-Shop-Sales
•	Overview: This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL for data extraction and Excel for visualization and dashboard creation. The analysis provides key insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and   product popularity, helping to inform business decisions. The main deliverable is an interactive dashboard that summarizes critical business metrics.


•	SQL for Data Manipulation: Utilized SQL queries to extract, clean, and aggregate raw sales data, calculating various metrics necessary for the analysis (e.g., total revenue, order counts, sales by category/size).


•	Excel for Visualization & Reporting: Leveraged Excel's powerful features to transform processed data into an intuitive and interactive dashboard. This dashboard integrates various chart types (bar charts, pie       charts, trend lines) to present complex data in an easily digestible format, enabling quick insights.


•	The insights gained from this project can be used to:

	Optimize staffing during peak hours.
 
	Refine the menu by promoting best-selling items and potentially re-evaluating poor-performing ones.
 
	Develop targeted marketing strategies based on popular pizza categories and sizes.
